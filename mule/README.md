### Mule project

We've included the entire project which you can import in the current version of MuleStudio (3.2.*) (in the folder **parrotproxy**).
We've also extracted the three files we've made ourselves if you do not want to go through the entire project (in the **src-files** folder). 

Of course you will need to change endpoint addresses to match your testing environment.
